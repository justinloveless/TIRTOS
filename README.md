# TIRTOS
This is the code for my embedded microcomputer systems class, wherein my teammate James Cockrell and I designed a robot with a real time operating system capable of handling multiple tasks in real time. 

For this class I had to program a robot in a team using the Texas Instruments Real Time Operating System (TIRTOS) such that it could communicate over Bluetooth, navigate a maze, take sensor readings, and calculate a PID control loop to remain a set distance away from the walls, all while going as quickly as smoothely as possible.
